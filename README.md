## Overview
The world is hungry for a new, secure, and equally scalable version of Twitter. Our Project, Skitter, aims to feed this hungry using cutting edge technologies to increase business velocity. With Skitter we hope to **always** think outside the box, even if mainstream metrics tell us not too. Take for example the way we house our "skits". Instead of using a traditional database, like lesser social media companies, we will utilize the scalability of ElasticSearch! Another example is the pure number of different technologies we use at Skitter. In our web application alone we develop using Python, Java, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and of course HTML/CSS. Others have said our ideas are "unattainable" or "unmaintainable". We aim to prove them all wrong.

## Network Topology

To show how non-mainstream we are simply observe above. Even our authentication is a counter to how the deep-tech media wants us to authenticate. We use RIT's LDAP as our sole authentication service!
